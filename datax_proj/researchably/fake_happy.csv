1,Liver X receptor α (LXRα/NR1H3) regulates differentiation of hepatocyte-like cells via reciprocal regulation of HNF4α.,"Kai-Ting Chen,Kelig Pernelle,Yuan-Hau Tsai,Yu-Hsuan Wu,Jui-Yu Hsieh,Ko-Hsun Liao,Christiane Guguen-Guillouzo,Hsei-Wei Wang",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25073010,"Gene expression profiles that reflect the differentiation of HepaRG progenitor cells into hepatocyte-like cells A protocol, which is described in the Materials and methods section ( Fig. Bipotent progenitor HepaRG cells, plated at 2.6 Â 10 4 cells/ cm 2 in the presence of insulin and corticosteroids, first gave rise to undifferentiated cells that actively proliferated for 7 days. To assess the functional status of HepaRG-derived hepatocyte-like cells, we determined the urea production and metabolic capacities of the differentiated cells. 1A), was used to induce the differentiation of human HepaRG progenitor cells in a synchronous fashion; the differentiation recapitulated the steps known to occur during hepatogenesis. 1E).Gene expression microarray analysis of the hepatogenesis of HepaRG cells at 3 stages (undifferentiated, committed, and differentiated) was carried out.",Primary,Randomize
2,"Effects of balanced propofol sedation on QT, corrected QT, and P-wave dispersion on upper endoscopy","Esef Bolat,Mehmet Çelikbilek,Savaş Sarıkaya,Yunus Keser Yılmaz,Serkan Doğan,Ömer Özbakır",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26488380,"Post-endoscopy QTc and QTd were decreased compared with baseline values, but these decreases were not statistically significant in the sedation group (431±25 vs. 416±30; p>0.05 and 62±28 vs. 43±22, respectively; p>0.05). In the sedation group, post-endoscopy P-max duration and Pwd were prolonged compared with baseline values (86±13 vs. 92±10 and 29±12 vs. 33±12, respectively; p<0.05). The comparison of the pre-and post-endoscopy values revealed no prolongation of P min duration in the sedation group (p>0.05). The mean age of patients in the control and sedation groups were 53.82±13.10 and 44.38±12.39 years, respectively. A combination of 2 mg of midazolam and an average of 59.50±28.09 mg of propofol was administered to the sedation group.",Secondary,Randomize
3,Prevalence of xerostomia and the salivary flow rate in diabetic patients.,"Barbara Malicka,Urszula Kaczmarek,Katarzyna Skośkiewicz-Malinowska",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24913113,"C1 -patients with diabetes type 1, C2 -patients with diabetes type 2, K1 control group to C1 -, K2 -control group to C2, ns.",Secondary,Non-Randomize
4,"Renal disease, the metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease.","Wendy E Hoy,Srinivas Kondalsamy-Chennakesavan,Stephen McDonald,Zhiqiang Wang",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16774010,"The table also shows considerable concentration of people with renal disease among those with the metabolic syndrome, however renal disease was defined. Rates of overweight and obesity by body mass index criteria were not uniformly excessive relative to those in the Australian non-Aboriginal population 18,19 but, waist measurements were often elevated, especially in females. This reflects the dominant role of elevated waist measurements, which are more common in females, 17 in driving the latter two definitions. The IDF.MS definition was more completely embraced by the other definitions, with 88% of the people so defined included in one or both of the other definitions (Figure 4). Table 3 shows that the (minimum) frequencies of the metabolic syndrome by the WHO, NCEP, and IDF definitions, respectively, were 22.2%, 25.9%, and 20.6%.",Secondary,Randomize
5,Cryoplasty for the treatment of femoropopliteal arterial disease: will freezing solve the problem of cold feet?,Thomas Jahnke,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16511955,"Initial technical success rate was achieved in all cases, but one patient needed stenting during the procedure due to dissection after balloon insufflation (Figures 4,  5 and 6). All patients were asymptomatic (Fontaine I, Rutherford 0) at the end of the followup (Figure 7).No patient had major or minor amputations, and there were no morbidities related to the procedure. Nine patients had limiting intermittent claudication of the lower extremity (Fontaine IIb and Rutheford 3), and one presented with ischemic   ulcers (Fontaine IV and Rutherford 6). Based on TASC II classification, seven patients were categorized as A, and three patients as B. From December 2006 to July 2007, ten patients underwent cryoplasty for femoropopliteal arterial occlusive disease at the Service of Endovascular Surgery, Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Curitiba, Curitiba (PR).",Primary,Non-Randomize
