It counts with around 54 thousand interviews per year and its main objective is to monitor the frequency and distribution of risk factors and protection for National Survey on Access, Use and Promotion of Rational Use of Drugs (PNAUM) in Brazil: 42 conducted in a partnership with 11 Higher Education Institutions, it is organized under two approach strategies: population components and services components. For the first component, 41,443 individuals of all ages, residents of urban areas, from the five Brazilian macroregions were interviewed from 23 September 2014 to January 2014, involving a total of 244 municipalities. 15 Ministry of Health Ordinance No. 23, dated 09/08/2012: 40 transfer of funds to health surveillance and promotion in the States, the Federal District and capital cities with over a million inhabitants, with the total amount of BRL 12.8 million, in a single installment, destined to the implementation of State and Municipal Plans for Tackling NCDs. The monitoring conducted in 2014 points that almost all the 55 places that appear in the Ordinance launched their Plans in 2012, and are, nowadays, in different stages of its implementation; some are revising the first Plan. It is important to highlight that the resources of the aforementioned Ordinance may be used in actions of NCDs surveillance and health promotion and many places adopted Ministry of Agrarian Development (MDA) Ministry of Education (MEC) Ministry of Fishing and Aquaculture (MPA) Ministry of Defense Ministry of Environment (MMA) Ministry of Social Security (MPS) Figure 5 -Conclusion"

MNCV in the sciatic nerves of control (CO), untreated diabetic in 4 and 10 weeks (DM1 and DM2 respectively) after STZ injection and P+4MC-treated diabetic (DMP4MC) rats. MNCV in DM1 and DM2 groups were significantly slower than CO and DMP4MC. Three samples of sciatic nerve motor responses recorded from, B. the control, C. diabetic and D.

Data are shown as mean Electron microscopy Fig 3: Light micrographs of toluidine blue stained transverse semi-thin section of the sciatic nerve at ×400 magnification, scale bar: 20 µm, V: vessel. (A) In the control group, myelinated nerve fibers are in normal morphology and structure (*). (B) In the untreated diabetic group, nerves revealed certain abnormalities, including: (1) degeneration, (2) myelin abnormalities including irregular fiber shapes, myelin infoldings and outfoldings and (3) alteration in myelin compaction. (C) In the P+4MC-treated diabetic group, the proportion of axons with myelin abnormality was significantly reduced. Also the number of small myelinated nerve fibers was increased in the diabetic group as compared with the other two groups.

1606,11448654,0," PURPOSE: As Robert Aquinas McNally mentions in his article ""Something in the Genes,"" p 15, when Henry Kaiser and Sidney Garfield, MD, created what is today Kaiser Permanente (KP), their vision ""… extended to bridging the institutional gap separating medical research from clinical medicine."" As our founders recognized the importance of independent research, and as KP continues this legacy today, The Permanente Journal has recognized the important work of Permanente researchers and promotes this work by reprinting abstracts in each issue. To further bridge this gap, we are now inviting the authors to briefly describe how his or her research can be embedded into daily practice. Beginning with this issue there will be a number of ""Clinical Implications"" boxes adjoining the related abstract from which you can glean the basic relevance of the abstract to your practice. permanente abstracts From Northern California: From Northern California: Variation in clinician recommendations for multiple injections during adoption of inactivated polio vaccine Lieu TA, Davis RL, Capra AM, et al.

3511,16986158,0," INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION METHODS CONCLUSIONS CONCLUSIONS [Oh et al., 2002; Chu et al., 2002; Ahlskog et al., 2001] HIHH tends to present in elderly women. The Asian preponderance of reports may suggest some genetic contribution. [Hashimoto et al., 1999; Oh et al., 2002; Hsu et al., 2004] [Oh et al., 2002; Ohara et al., 2001] The exact mechanism of HIHH remains speculative. This literature is complicated by early reports that include a heterogeneous collection of causes including petechiae hemorrhage [Ahlskog et al., 2001; Shan, 2005] calcification [Shan, 2005], demyelination [Lai et al., 1996], regional metabolic failure from cerebral vascular insufficiency and metabolic derangement [Hsu et al., 2004] , and protein desiccation in the course of Wallerian degeneration [Wintermark et al., 2004]. Some have also combined this with the dystonic and choreatic movements seen in non-ketotic hyperglycemia, which resolve immediately upon glucose correction.

Goals Introduction Methods Setting Study Population Statistical Analysis Results Discussion Conclusion Introduction Differences Between Entamoeba Species Amebiasis-or Disparosis? Until recently, Entamoeba histolytica was regarded Clinical Recommendations Conclusion No. 3; July, 1944 of the Permanente Foundation Medical Bulletin, edited by Dr. Morris Collen from 1943 to 1953, is ""Management of the Menopause,"" by Dr. David James. Dr. James was then a member of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of The Northern Permanente Foundation, in Vancouver, Washington, but he left our organization shortly after to practice elsewhere. Dr. Reva Winkler of the Southern California Permanente Medical Group Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology has written not only a Commentary on Dr. James' article but a beautifully constructed, brief, personalized update of the topic which will be very helpful to practicing physicians. She is undoubtedly correct in concluding that many physicians of Dr. James' era readily dismissed the sufferings of menopausal women. I am reminded of my first introduction to the subject 45 years ago (not too long after Dr. James wrote his article). It was by a lecturer in my second year of medical school pharmacology course, who told us that it was easy to deal with any unexplained symptoms in a woman between the ages of 40-50. He said ""Just call it the menopause, and give her hormones."" I believe that, in this area, we have come a long way. -Arthur Klatsky, MD, Section Editor Management of the Menopause The Menopausal Syndrome Kaiser Permanente Medicine 50 Years Ago Management of the Menopause Management Estrogens Available clinical contributions Discussion Summary Menopause-Then and Now Commentary by Reva Winkler, MD Kaiser Permanente, Los Angeles Managing Menopause in 1998 Introduction Ellen Strugatch, LPC Ellen Strugatch is the Georgia Massachusetts North Carolina Oregon/Washington Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound Be a part of future health systems management discussions Dr. Jacobs: Tell us more about these 'critical success factors.'
